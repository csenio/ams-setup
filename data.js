      '<h2 class="blog-post__quote">“We had established a strong employer brand, but we found it hard to attract the right people. The quality of candidates through One. was very good as they listened very good to our wishes in terms of skills and behavior. For all positions we were able to pick and choose.”<p>— Manfred</p></h2><h2>The challenge</h2><p>Egbert: &#8220;50five is growing internationally and after growing 1400% in the last few years, we found ourselves at the crossroads of building a team to bring us to the next phase. For our business it is important to have a team of people who understand retail, e-commerce and are entrepreneurial, and that can be hard to find”. Manfred: “On recruitment, we had some stuff already in place. For example, we put a lot of effort in building a strong employer brand. We want our team to be happy with their work and be true ambassadors. Also we tried working with several agencies before. However, we still struggled to attract the perfect matches. Also we just did not have the manpower in-house to be fully committed to recruitment and bring in high numbers of applicants.”</p><h2>Working with New Amsterdam Capital</h2><p>Manfred: &#8220;We met the New Amsterdam Team in February for the first time at our office in Eindhoven. We had a good conversation in which all the line-managers were able to express their needs and the problems they were running into in their own teams. This, basically to give New Amsterdam Capital a kick-start.” Egbert: “Within a few days, we were happy to see that New Amsterdam Capital had set up a great careers-page for us, with all the open jobs. It was spot-on, sharing our established employer brand! The team also explained to us, how their Applicant Tracking System worked, and we liked the transparency. They gave us access to the system, so we are able to have a look at what’s going on at any time. Over the weeks, we started noticing how dedicated New Amsterdam Works. Our days are pretty full and often we are only available in the evening or the really early morning. Our contact person at New Amsterdam Capital was always available by phone, and never cut corners on bringing us up to date, and pointing us in the right direction. It is just really nice to know someone is working on your behalf, and really dedicating himself to bring you the best results.”</p><h2>Results</h2><p>Within the first 8 weeks, we were able to achieve the first 6 hires, both on Tech and Non-tech. We always work according to the priority of the company. Our work is not done yet, and the project is still active. We are even proud to say that we are extending our project with 50five, as the working-relationship has been very much appreciated from both sides. Manfred: “I like how New Amsterdam Capital always thinks together with us. When the pressure was off, by hiring the first key positions, they suggested to extend the project but on a lower intensity than how we started off. This is what you need as a company to work in full partnership!”</p><h2>About 50five</h2><p>&#8216;Smart advice for every smart device&#8217;. Meet 50five: the #1 authority in smart home. Home automation offers connected devices enhancing the comfort in your home. From efficient heating and energy saving to endless lighting possibilities, attentive security solutions and smart audio devices, all connected to your smartphone.

      ' <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember when leaving a cushy corporate gig to take a job at a high-growth tech company was considered risky, or even foolish? Much was talked about jeopardising secure career trajectories or risking unexplainable, even downright embarrassing gaps in one&#8217;s CV should the startup fail.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are those days. Fast growing tech companies have become appealing employers for the excitement, opportunities, their fast pace and the possible reward of a successful exit. And despite all the hype around founders and entrepreneurship, we can still witness regular pitting of the „startup type“ against the „corporate type“ when it comes to talent. My experience of recruiting for high-growth tech companies for almost 20 years has taught me that there is not only a place but a need for both types. And that’s especially true for hyper-growth companies. Let me tell you why:</span></p><p><b>Your management know-how will move the needle</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‘s no secret that the excitement for many young professionals around joining a startup lies in the lack of „structure and processes“ as they will have greater responsibility much faster than their corporate peers. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But here is the naked truth: once a business received a first or second VC round, it gathers velocity and must rapidly cross the bridge from startup to scaleup. That means moving from the “founding few” to a “grown-up” company that matches its product and growth ambitions. Hiring, onboarding, let alone leading winning teams that can scale at rapid pace will be an unfruitful, and down-right problematic endeavour without putting structures and processes in place. The jack-of-all-trades kind of professional that an early stage venture relied on will need to be paired with experts, that bring order to chaos with functional and management know-how. That‘s where your experience garnered in big companies can really come to shine.</span></p><p><b>Your expertise can shape the future of your sector</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raison d’etre of many new tech businesses is to disrupt traditional ways of doing business, or even entire industries. But to build solid products and services that deliver on the ambition, founders need to bring „insider“ knowledge on board. Hiring a professional with the exact kind of experience from the corporate side will be indispensable for navigating the intricacies of a specific marketplace, or for advancing a business model that evolves, disrupts, or even upends a sector. The benefit? You can take your career to the next level and take ownership for shaping the future of your industry. </span></p><p><b>You can actually have a say in what happens in the business</b><b><br /></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By necessity, startups are small, and every employee has to wear many different hats on a daily basis. While much of the glory in the startup world is assigned to the founders, it’s the founder’s team that is doing the exciting and important work of building the future. That means everyone, and especially those in leadership positions have a very real opportunity to help define and direct the business. You have an active say in how the business should operate, what it should do, and where improvements could be made. You’re no longer just a number in the corporate machine, but instead you are operating it. You are driving it forward. The company is growing? That means you are growing. </span></p><p><b>Innovation is part of your job description</b><b><br /></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once injected with funding, especially of the VC kind, scaleups move fast, much faster than both, their startup and their corporate counterparts. Rapid testing and implementation of innovative ideas is a key part of this world. Basically, it’s an unspoken rule in your job description that you will innovate. Yes, you’ll help with the overarching innovative idea of the business, but you’ll also do it internally. You’ll be fixing and improving internal processes, you may even redefine your own job along the way, and constantly work on making innovation a business-as-usual process within the business.

    text: `<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al 6 jaar verbindt Ageras klanten met accountants en boekhouders in Denemarken, Zweden, Noorwegen, Nederland, Duitsland en het Verenigd Koninkrijk. Het succesverhaal begon in Kopenhagen, maar nu is het tijd voor een spannend nieuw hoofdstuk: de opening van een kantoor in Amsterdam!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ageras en One. zitten op dezelfde verdieping en een partnership was dan ook snel gesloten. Voor het opzetten van het eerste buitenlandse team helpt One. met o.a. employer branding en het vinden van de juiste mensen om van Ageras Nederland een groot succes te maken. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Het Nederlandse team onder leiding van </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nfpfeyffer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bestaat nu uit Customer Success Managers </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/romy-van-t-laar-040978104/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> en </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johanvalentijn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, en als Account Manager </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-wilmink-7a9000a6/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ageras is een slim platform dat boekhouders en accountants aan klanten koppelt. In het team zorgen de accountmanagers er voor dat er nieuwe accountants aan het platform worden aangesloten, en de customer success managers zijn verantwoordelijk voor de B2C zijde van de ‘marktplaats’. </span></p><p><b><i>Sophie Wilmink: </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sinds 1 februari 2019 ben ik Account Manager bij Ageras. Dit houdt in dat ik verantwoordelijk ben voor het succes van de samenwerking met onze partners, boekhouders en accountants door het hele land. Ik ben dagelijks bezig met mijn eigen partner portfolio en het uitbreiden hiervan. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ik heb voor Ageras gekozen om vanaf begin te bouwen aan het nieuwe Nederlandse kantoor. Ageras heeft een bewezen propositie in Europa, veel potentie om snel te schalen en is al een aantal jaar actief op de Nederlandse markt. Toch is de opening van het fysieke kantoor een grote stap en het leek mij een mooie uitdaging om hier vanaf het allereerste begin bij te zijn. Het is een ontzettend interessante en leerzame periode om in te stappen, ook nu nog. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We staan aan het begin van iets moois, het is hard werken om daar te komen maar biedt absoluut perspectief. Ageras is een jong en dynamisch bedrijf. De bedrijfscultuur zou ik omschrijven als ambitieus maar met een zeer positieve sfeer. Als Ageras NL zitten wij eigenlijk nog in het proces om onze eigen sub-cultuur te vormen. Het huidige Nederlandse team is nog klein maar erg gezellig. We zijn allemaal vastberaden om het kantoor in Nederland tot een groot succes te brengen en staan dus met de neuzen dezelfde kant op. Verder kijken wij er erg naar uit om het team verder uit te breiden. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanneer je op zoek bent naar een uitdagende (sales-)functie in een snelgroeiende internationale organisatie is Ageras de juiste keuze!</span></p><p><b>Romy van ‘t Laar: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Als Customer Success Manager help ik de klant van begin tot eind met het uitzoeken van wat ze precies nodig hebben, en met het vinden van de juiste boekhouder/accountant. Ik vind het belangrijk om relaties goed te onderhouden en een klantenportfolio opbouwen. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">De voornaamste reden dat ik heb gekozen om bij Ageras te gaan werken is de bedrijfscultuur. Daarnaast vind ik het heel gaaf om deel uit te maken van het eerste Nederlandse team. Er komen een hoop extra verantwoordelijkheden bij kijken als je met een klein groepje een nieuw kantoor op zet. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hebben een echte work-hard-play-hard cultuur, en iedereen krijgt een stem om mee te denken. Ik heb al heel veel geleerd hier en daar is bij ons ook alle ruimte voor. We hebben een gezellig team met verschillende personaliteiten, maar iedereen kan goed met elkaar overweg. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ik denk dat je Ageras moet kiezen als je deel uit wilt maken van een interessant, snelgroeiend bedrijf en als je veel wilt leren en snel wilt doorgroeien. </span></p><p><b>Jobs</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bij Ageras Nederland zoeken we meerdere Account Managers en daarnaast ook een Customer Success Manager. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alle jobs kun je vinden op: <a href="https://joinone.recruitee.com/">https://joinone.recruitee.com/</a></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of, stuur een mailtje naar Tim (<a href="mailto:tim@oneworks.co">tim@oneworks.co</a>)</span></p>`
